## About The App

- General Information

[CountryBeen](https://country-been.vercel.app/) is one of my personal projects focusing on taking advantage of REST API (Country REST API), using React with Typescript to strictly check every variables in my projects to make the development more smoothly. Also, I adopt managing state by Redux-toolkit.

This application introduces react-simple-app, a library for React helping users to showcase world-map with easy setups. Plus, when it comes to the styling part, introducing Tailwind CSS and DaisyUI, a third-party library for Tailwind CSS makes the design better a lot.

## Technologies

- `React` - version 18.1.0
- `Redux` - version 4.2.0
- `Typescript` - version 4.6.4
- `TailWind CSS` - version 3.0.24

## Setup

- Download or clone the repository
- Run `npm install`
- Run `npm run dev` to start running the app

## Approach

- Utilize Next.js to simplify compositions of application as well as maximize powerful features of Next.js such as Server-Side Rendering
- Introducing `next-theme` that is a library for next.js, automatically toggling light mode and dark mode based on users' screen modes
- Restricted the initial number of pokemons showcased in home page considering about the workloads of server and performances of the application
- Tried to make design simplify but have good-looking styles by taking advantage of `TailWind CSS` and UI components provided by `flowbite`.

## Status

[CountryBeen](https://country-been.vercel.app/) is still in progress (adding more features). Currently I'm adding database (firebase) to store the records efficiently to enhance the quality of the application.
